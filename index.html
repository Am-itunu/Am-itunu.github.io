        <P class="summary"> Welcome to My Portfolio!</P>
        <p class="summary">
            Hello, and thank you for visiting. I'm Itunuoluwa, an Entry Level Software Developer with a fresh perspective 
            and a recently earned master's degree in computing.
            With a strong background in object-oriented programming and related technologies, 
            I thrive on turning ideas into functional and efficient code.
            My passion for software development is complemented by a keen interest in software testing, 
            ensuring the delivery of high-quality, reliable solutions.
            Beyond the lines of code, I find joy in creative pursuits. Designing and fashion illustration are not just hobbies 
            but outlets for my artistic expression. I believe that creativity enhances problem-solving and innovation in software development.
            
            In addition to crafting code and designs, I'm an avid player of strategic games. This hobby reflects my mindset in approaching challenges methodically and strategically, skills that I bring to my software development projects.

            Throughout my academic and professional journey, I've had the privilege of collaborating with diverse individuals and teams. These experiences have been invaluable in honing my skills and gaining practical insights into the dynamic world of software development.
            
            I invite you to explore my portfolio and discover the intersection of my technical skills and creative endeavors. Whether it's coding, testing, design, or strategic thinking, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.
            
            Thank you once again for your visit.
            
            
        </p>
